This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

ToDoList is general-purpose, Windows-based software, which can be used for simple “honey do” home lists or to manage complex multi-user projects for business.ToDoList is software in the category of Task Management, Project Management, Productivity, “Getting Things Done” (GTD), Scheduling, and Collaboration.

We have a lot of choices to help us keep track of daily obligations. A simple list on paper of things “To Do” is enough for some people. Others prefer to use programs. People have preferences about where they keep track of tasks - with PC utilities (“thick app”), websites (“thin app”), on phone (“mobile”) apps.
